The posting acceptance tests are different for `discussion groups`_,
`announcement groups`_ and `support groups`_. However, the `post
appearance`_ is the same in all groups.

Discussion Groups
=================

The posting behaviour is different for `the anonymous user`_, a `logged
in non-member`_ and a `normal member`_.

The Anonymous User
------------------

* When an anonymous user views the group:

  + The link to start a new topic (on the *Topics* page) is hidden.

    - The user is told that he or she cannot start a topic.
    - A link to *Sign up* is presented.

  +  The *Add to Topic* form on the *Topic* page is hidden from the
     anonymous user.

    - The user is told that he or she cannot add to the topic.
    - A link to *Sign up* is presented.
  
* When an anonymous user sends an email to the group:

  + A reply is sent, stating that there was an error.
  + The message does not appear in the group.
  + The rejection is logged (see `Ticket 453`_).

Logged In Non-Member
--------------------

* When a logged in non-member views the group views the group:

  + The link to start a new topic (on the *Topics* page) is hidden.

    - The user is told that he or she cannot start a topic.
    - A link to *Join* is presented.

  + The *Add to Topic* form on the *Topic* page is hidden from the
    anonymous user.

    - The user is told that he or she cannot add to the topic.
    - A link to *Join* is presented.
  
* When a non-member sends an email to the group:

  + A reply is sent, stating that there was an error.
  + The message does not appear in the group.
  + The rejection is logged (see `Ticket 453`_).


Normal Member
-------------

* The user can `post from the web`_ if the `reasons to block posting`_ 
  are not met.
  
* When a member sends an email to the group:

  + All group members receive the post, including the member who posted.
  
    - The ``Reply-to`` header is set to the email address of the group.
    - If there were attachments, they are are stripped and replaced
      with links to the group.
    - All other information is unchanged.
  
  + People who are not members of the group do not get the post.
  + The `post appearance`_ is correct.

Post from the Web
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* A link to the *Start a New Topic* page is shown from the *Topics* 
  page. The form lists
  
  + The subject entry for the new topic
  + The email address for the author (providing a selector if multiple
    addresses are associated with the profile of the author)
  + A message entry.
  + A file entry. If a file is added 
  
    - The name of the added file appears where the entry was, and
    - The file entry is blank.
  
* The *Add to Topic* form is shown at the bottom of every *Topic*
  page. The form is the same as for *Start a New Topic* except that
  there is no subject entry.
  
* When either form is submitted
  
  + The `post appearance`_ is correct. In addition the following
    should hold.
    
    - A new topic should be started if a new subject line was added
      to the *Start a New Topic* page.
    - The post should be added to an existing topic if an existing
      subject is added to the *Start a New Topic* page.
    - The post should appear on same topic as the *Add to Topic* form 
      appears on.    
  
  + An email is sent to all group members. 

Reasons to Block Posting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below are the six reasons to block posting to a discussion group.

* The group is closed
* The posting member has no preferred email addresses
* The posting member has hit the posting limit **and** the posting member
  is a normal member. (*Administrators* are not subject to the rate 
  limit.)
* The posting member is explicitly blocked from posting
* The posting member lacks the required_properties for the
  
  + Site
  + Group

Announcement Groups
===================

Announcement groups are similar to `discussion groups`_ except they
have `posting members`_ as well as `non-posting members`_. The `post
appearance`_ is the same.

Posting Members
---------------

A posting member of an announcement group should see the same behaviour
as a `normal member`_ of a discussion group.

Non-Posting Members
-------------------

* The link to start a new topic (on the *Topics* page) is hidden.

  + The user is told that he or she cannot start a topic.

* The *Add to Topic* form on the *Topic* page is hidden.

  + The user is told that he or she cannot add to the topic.

* If the non-posting member sends an email to the announcement group
  he or she is sent a message saying the message was not added to the
  group.

Support Groups
==============

There are fewer posting restrictions to a support group. 

* For members support groups behave like `discussion groups`_.
* Non-members
  
  + Can post to a support group using email, but
  + *Cannot* post to a support group using the web (see `Ticket 171`_).

* Blocked members can post to a support group (see `Ticket 459`_).
* The `post appearance`_ should be the same as all other groups.

Post Appearance
===============

For most pages the `basic appearance`_ of posts is the same. However the
`Topic page`_, `Posts page`_, `Summary of Posts page`_, `Single Post
page`_ and `Web feed`_ have differences.

Basic Appearance
----------------

* The subject line of the post is stripped of all 

  + ``Re:``
  + ``Fwd:``
  + ``Fw:`` and
  + ``[]`` sequences.

* The post metadata shows

  + When the post was made
  + Who made the post
  + A profile photo of the person who made the post is shown if the 
    person has one.
    
* The post text is split in two.

  #. The first half shows all the text before the signature and bottom
     quoting. The first half is shown by default.
  #. The second half is hidden by default. When open it shows the
     signature and bottom quoting (see `Ticket 456`_).

* The post links to all the files that were attached to it.
  
Topic Page
----------
  
* A post appears on the *Topic* page with the same subject line.
* If there is only one post in the topic the *Summary* is hidden.
* If there are multiple posts:

  - The posts are arranged from oldest to newest.
  - The *Summary* lists the number of posts, the number of authors, and
    links to the latest post.

Posts Page
----------

* The post appears on the *Posts* page.
* The post has its subject line included in its metadata.
* The post has the same subject line as the `Topic page` that it 
  appears on.
* The post links to the Topic page.

Summary of Posts Page
---------------------

* The post appears on the *Summary of Posts* page.
* The following meatadata appears:
  
  + Author (which links to the profile page of the author)
  + Subject (which links to the `single post page`_)
  + Files (which has an icon for every file) and
  + Date.

Single Post Page
----------------

* The *Single Post* page links to 

  + The topic
  + The first post in the topic
  + The last post in the topic
  + The previous post in the topic
  + The next post in the topic

Web Feed
--------

* The web feed shows the same posts as the `Posts page`.
* Each post links to the `Single Post page` for the post.
* Each post has a single-line summary.
* Each post shows only the first half of the message (see 
  `Basic Appearance`_.)
* Each post links to the attached files.
