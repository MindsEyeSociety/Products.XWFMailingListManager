The posting acceptance tests are different for `discussion groups`_,
`announcement groups`_ and `support groups`_. However, the `post
appearance`_ is the same in all groups.

Discussion Groups
=================

The posting behaviour is different for `the anonymous user`_, a `logged
in non-member`_ and a `normal member`_.

The Anonymous User
------------------

* When an anonymous user views the group:

  + The link to start a new topic (on the *Topics* page) is hidden.

    - The user is told that he or she cannot start a topic.
    - A link to *Sign up* is presented.

  +  The *Add to Topic* form on the *Topic* page is hidden from the
     anonymous user.

    - The user is told that he or she cannot add to the topic.
    - A link to *Sign up* is presented.
  
* When an anonymous user sends an email to the group:

  + A reply is sent, stating that there was an error.
  + The message does not appear in the group.
  + The rejection is logged (see `Ticket 453`_).

Logged In Non-Member
--------------------

* When a logged in non-member views the group views the group:

  + The link to start a new topic (on the *Topics* page) is hidden.

    - The user is told that he or she cannot start a topic.
    - A link to *Join* is presented.

  + The *Add to Topic* form on the *Topic* page is hidden from the
    anonymous user.

    - The user is told that he or she cannot add to the topic.
    - A link to *Join* is presented.
  
* When a non-member sends an email to the group:

  + A reply is sent, stating that there was an error.
  + The message does not appear in the group.
  + The rejection is logged (see `Ticket 453`_).


Normal Member
-------------

* The user can `post from the web`_ if the `reasons to block posting`_ 
  are not met.
  
* When a member sends an email to the group:

  + All group members receive the post, including the member who posted.
  
    - The ``Reply-to`` header is set to the email address of the group.
    - If there were attachments, they are are stripped and replaced
      with links to the group.
    - All other information is unchanged.
  
  + People who are not members of the group do not get the post.
  + The `post appearance`_ is correct.

Post from the Web
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* A link to the *Start a New Topic* page is shown from the *Topics* 
  page. The form lists
  
  + The subject entry for the new topic
  + The email address for the author (providing a selector if multiple
    addresses are associated with the profile of the author)
  + A message entry.
  + A file entry. If a file is added 
  
    - The name of the added file appears where the entry was, and
    - The file entry is blank.
  
* The *Add to Topic* form is shown at the bottom of every *Topic*
  page. The form is the same as for *Start a New Topic* except that
  there is no subject entry.
  
* When either form is submitted
  
  + The `post appearance`_ is correct. In addition the following
    should hold.
    
    - A new topic should be started if a new subject line was added
      to the *Start a New Topic* page.
    - The post should be added to an existing topic if an existing
      subject is added to the *Start a New Topic* page.
    - The post should appear on same topic as the *Add to Topic* form 
      appears on.    
  
  + An email is sent to all group members. 

Reasons to Block Posting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below are the six reasons to block posting to a discussion group.

* The group is closed
* The posting member has no preferred email addresses
* The posting member has hit the posting limit **and** the posting member
  is a normal member. (*Administrators* are not subject to the rate 
  limit.)
* The posting member is explicitly blocked from posting
* The posting member lacks the required_properties for the
  
  + Site
  + Group

Announcement Groups
===================

Announcement groups are similar to `discussion groups`_ except they
have `posting members`_ as well as `non-posting members`_. The `post
appearance`_ is the same.

Posting Members
---------------

A posting member of an announcement group should see the same behaviour
as a `normal member`_ of a discussion group.

Non-Posting Members
-------------------

* The link to start a new topic (on the *Topics* page) is hidden.

  + The user is told that he or she cannot start a topic.

* The *Add to Topic* form on the *Topic* page is hidden.

  + The user is told that he or she cannot add to the topic.

* If the non-posting member sends an email to the announcement group
  he or she is sent a message saying the message was not added to the
  group.

Support Groups
==============

There are fewer posting restrictions to a support group. 

* For members support groups behave like `discussion groups`_.
* Non-members
  
  + Can post to a support group using email, but
  + *Cannot* post to a support group using the web (see `Ticket 171`_).

* Blocked members can post to a support group (see `Ticket 459`_).
* The `post appearance`_ should be the same as all other groups.

Post Appearance
===============

For most pages the `basic appearance`_ of posts is the same. However the
`Topic page`_, `Posts page`_, `Summary of Posts page`_, `Single Post
page`_ and `Web feed`_ have differences.

Basic Appearance
----------------

* The subject line of the post is stripped of all 

  + ``Re:``
  + ``Fwd:``
  + ``Fw:`` and
  + ``[]`` sequences.

* The post metadata shows

  + When the post was made
  + Who made the post
  + A profile photo of the person who made the post is shown if the 
    person has one.
    
* The post text is split in two.

  #. The first half shows all the text before the signature and bottom
     quoting. The first half is shown by default.
  #. The second half is hidden by default. When open it shows the
     signature and bottom quoting (see `Ticket 456`_).

* The post links to all the files that were attached to it.
  
Topic Page
----------
  
* A post appears on the *Topic* page with the same subject line.
* If there is only one post in the topic the *Summary* is hidden.
* If there are multiple posts:

  - The posts are arranged from oldest to newest.
  - The *Summary* lists the number of posts, the number of authors, and
    links to the latest post.

Posts Page
----------

* The post appears on the *Posts* page.
* The post has its subject line included in its metadata.
* The post has the same subject line as the `Topic page` that it 
  appears on.
* The post links to the Topic page.

Summary of Posts Page
---------------------

* The post appears on the *Summary of Posts* page.
* The following meatadata appears:
  
  + Author (which links to the profile page of the author)
  + Subject (which links to the `single post page`_)
  + Files (which has an icon for every file) and
  + Date.

Single Post Page
----------------

* The *Single Post* page links to 

  + The topic
  + The first post in the topic
  + The last post in the topic
  + The previous post in the topic
  + The next post in the topic

Web Feed
--------

* The web feed shows the same posts as the `Posts page`.
* Each post links to the `Single Post page` for the post.
* Each post has a single-line summary.
* Each post shows only the first half of the message (see 
  `Basic Appearance`_.)
* Each post links to the attached files.

Blocked Address
===============

With the completion of `Ticket 459`_ an address can be *blocked* by
adding an entry for the address in the ``email_blacklist`` relational
database table. The table below summarises the correct behaviour for
blocking, for the different group privacy levels and membership statuses.

======= ======= =========== ======= =========== ======= =========== 
Group   Member              Non-member          Anonymous
------- ------------------- ------------------- ------------------- 
Privacy Blocked Not Blocked Blocked Not Blocked Blocked Not Blocked
======= ======= =========== ======= =========== ======= =========== 
Public  Block   Post        Block   Can't post  Block   Email reply
Private Block   Post        Block   Can't post  Block   Email reply
Secret  Block   Post        Block   Can't post  Block   Email reply
Support Block   Post        Block   Post        Block   Post
======= ======= =========== ======= =========== ======= =========== 

The three different actions are as follows.

Block
  The post is blocked, the blocking is logged, and no notice is sent.

Post
  The message is posted to the group: the post appears in the group,
  and all members get a notification of the new message.
  
Can't post
  The sender gets a *Cannot Post* notification.

Email reply
  The sender (who does not have a profile on the site) gets an
  *Email Reply* message (see the ``email_reply`` page template in the
  List Manager.

Todo
====

Script this test case up using `Selenium`_. Random post content is
needed, but the ``fortune`` programme is good for this::
  
  $ fortune -n 80 -s # A short quote for the subject line.
  $ fortune -n 80 -l # A long quote for the body.
